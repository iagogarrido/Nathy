-----------------------
Cathy File Format v2.24
-----------------------

Remaining questions: 
  Exact format of version identifier at beginning of file
  4 unknown bytes in directory listing
  5 unknown bytes in volume listing

-----------
File header
-----------
6 bytes -- header, seemingly remain constant across all volumes (27 06 a4 d0 05 00)
  Seems to be version identifier
4 bytes -- volume date (little Endian, Unix timestamp)
* bytes -- null-terminated string, indexed path ("F:\")
* bytes -- null-terminated string, volume name ("Juegos 8")
* bytes -- null-terminated string, recorded name ("")
4 bytes -- serial number in hex ('14', '71', '4a', 'e2' becomes "E24A-7114")
* bytes -- null-terminated string, comment
4 bytes -- free space (IEEE 754)
  For CD-ROMs and DVDs, seems to be set to 00 00 80 BF -- flag value interpreted as "---N/A---"

------------------
Directories header
------------------
4 bytes -- how many directory records follow
* bytes -- null-terminated string, root name

-----------
Directories
-----------
All directories listed near beginning -- root, sub, sub-sub, etc.
  Directories are also represented among listing of files

First directory is root directory
  12 bytes, how many files, unknown, filesize of directory

4 bytes -- how many files (does not include directories! just files) directory contains (recursively)
4 bytes -- unknown, always (00 00 00 00)
4 bytes -- filesize of directory (seemingly floating point, but I can't figure out format, no IEEE 754)
  Example: A5 DC C4 41 = 667.581 MiB

--------------
Entries header
--------------
4 bytes -- number of directories and files ("D+F") in volume
  Increasing the last byte makes Cathy take an incredibly long time to launch, and to gradually eat more memory
    Making it "00 00 00 01" made Cathy take on the order of ten minutes to launch, and eat over a gig of RAM
    When it did finally launch, D+F was shown as 2^24, just as one would expect
  Given performance observations, Cathy must allocate memory for all the directory entries that follow based on this number
    Indeed, if it is set to 1 for volume with >1 directory entries, only one directory entry shows up when browsing directory hierarchy -- none of the others are loaded
    Setting it to more than number of actual directory entries does not seem to have deleterious effect

-------
Entries
-------
4 bytes -- entry date
4 bytes -- depends if file or directory
  - Files: filesize as unsigned int
    Example of conversion in Ruby: 0x6c*256**0 + 0x05*256**1 + 0xfc*256**2 + 0x3f*256**3
  - Directories: index of directory in directories section (negative value)
    Size of directory taken from record in "directories" section
2 bytes -- what directory entry belongs to
  00 00 = root directory
  Directories don't seem to be explicitly numbered -- instead, this value refers to position 
  of directory in list of directories
* bytes -- null-terminated string, entryname

----
Misc
----
Difference between Cathy v2.15.2 and v2.24 file formats is not trivial
  v2.15.2 indicates string length by prefixing string with byte representing length
  v2.24 omits this, instead storing null terminator byte at end of string
